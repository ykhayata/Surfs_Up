## Summary 

After analyzing the weather data, we can come to the conclusion that opening a Surf Shop would be a great investment! We analyzed two months in polar opposite weather seasons (June and December), and the difference between the two is not significant by any means. The average temperature in June is only 4 degrees warmer than the average temperature in December. Whether you visit Oahu in the summer or winter, you are guranteed to enjoy some beautiful warm weather. Now, to dive even deeper into our analysis, we looked at precipitation statistics in June vs December. 

### Precipitation Statistics

1: The average percipitation is 0.14 inches per day in June

2: The average percipitation is 0.22 inches per day in December

3: 50% of days in June have less than 0.02 inches of percipitation and 75% of the days have less than 0.12 inches of percipitation

4: 50% of days in December have less than 0.03 inches of percipitation and 75% of the days have less than 0.15 inches of percipitation

Sure, rain falls more often in December, compared to June but this analysis tells us that 75% of the days in December experience less than 0.15 inches, which is very minimal. This tells us that the Surf Shop is expected to be open year-round with the exception of a couple unexpected rainy days. For the most partm W. Avy should be more than comfortable investing in this shop.
